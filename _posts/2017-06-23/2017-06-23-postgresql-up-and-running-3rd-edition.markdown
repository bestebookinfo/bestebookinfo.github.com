***PostgreSQL: Up and Running: A Practical Guide to the Advanced Open Source Database***

Thinking of migrating to PostgreSQL? This clear, fast-paced introduction helps you understand and use this open source database system. Not only will you learn about the enterprise class features in versions 9.3 to 9.6, with a focus on 9.5, you’ll also discover that PostgeSQL is more than a database system—it’s an impressive application platform as well.

With examples throughout, this book shows you how to achieve tasks that are difficult or impossible in other databases. This third edition covers new features, such as ANSI-SQL constructs found only in proprietary databases until now: PostgreSQL FDW enhancements; new full text functions and operator syntax introduced in version 9.6; row level security; and the UPSERT feature.

If you’re a current PostgreSQL user, you’ll pick up gems you may have missed before.
