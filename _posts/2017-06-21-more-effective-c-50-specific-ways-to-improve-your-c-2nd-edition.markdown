In More Effective C#, Second Edition, world-renowned .NET expert Bill Wagner identifies and illuminates 50 intermediate-to-advanced techniques for writing exceptionally robust and well-performing C# 7.0 code. Reflecting the growing sophistication of the C# language and its development community, Wagner presents powerful new solutions to problems you’re likely to encounter every day.

Through three editions of Effective C#, Wagner’s clear explanations, expert tips, and realistic code examples have proven invaluable to hundreds of thousands of developers. Now, he brings the same proven approach to C# 7.0, focusing especially on new features that help you perform familiar tasks more efficiently and effectively.

Drawing on his unsurpassed C# experience and key role on global C# standards committees, Wagner addresses object-oriented, functional, and service-oriented approaches to managing data with C#; better ways to express your intent to users and other programmers; and new opportunities to leverage powerful asynchronous and dynamic programming techniques.

- Use properties instead of accessible data members (see Item 1)

- Distinguish between value and reference types (see Item 4)

- Understand relationships among multiple concepts of equality (see Item 9)

- Avoid conversion operators in your APIs (see Item 11)

- Understand how interface and virtual methods differ (see Item 15)

- Avoid overloading methods defined in base classes (see Item 19)

- Create method groups that are clear, minimal, and complete (see Item 22)

- Enable immediate error reporting in iterators and async methods (see Item 26)

- Use async methods for async work (see Item 27)

- Avoid thread allocations and context switches (see Item 30)

- Construct PLINQ parallel algorithms with exceptions in mind (see Item 36)

- Use the thread pool instead of creating threads (see Item 37)

- Use backgroundworker for cross-thread communication (see Item 38)

- Use the smallest possible scope for lock handles (see Item 41)

- Understand the pros and cons of dynamic programming (see Item 43)

- Make full use of the expression API (item 46)

- Minimize dynamic objects in public APIs (item 47)

You’re already a successful C# programmer: this book will make you an outstanding one.

Content Update Program: This book is part of the InformIT Content Update Program. As updates are made to C#, sections of this book will be updated or new sections will be added to match updates to the technologies. See inside for details.
