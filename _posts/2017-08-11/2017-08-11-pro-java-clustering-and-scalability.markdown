Build clustered and scalable Java-based, real-time applications using Spring Framework, Boot, WebSocket, Cassandra, Redis and RabbitMQ. In this book, you'll tie all this together with a dive-in case study, a real-time scalable chat application under differing scenarios. Pro Java Clustering and Scalability also discusses how to horizontally scale the WebSocket chat application using a full STOMP broker such as RabbitMQ.

Although this is a programming book, it also discusses many interesting infrastructure topics and tips about continuous delivery, Docker, NoSQL (Cassandra and Redis) and other related technologies.

### What You'll Learn

- Handle clustering and scalability using various open source Java, microservices, and web services tools and technologies
- Use Spring Framework, Boot, and other Spring technologies
- Integrate with Redis, RabbitMQ, Cassandra, NoSQL,
- Test the case study code under various scenarios and stresses
