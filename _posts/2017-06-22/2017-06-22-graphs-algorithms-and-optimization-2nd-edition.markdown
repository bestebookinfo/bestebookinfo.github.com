The second edition of this popular book presents the theory of graphs from an algorithmic viewpoint. The authors present the graph theory in a rigorous, but informal style and cover most of the main areas of graph theory. The ideas of surface topology are presented from an intuitive point of view. We have also included a discussion on linear programming that emphasizes problems in graph theory. The text is suitable for students in computer science or mathematics programs.
