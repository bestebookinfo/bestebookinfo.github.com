If you’re working on the Web, you’ve probably heard something about Progressive Web Apps. But what exactly are they and what kind of benefit will they bring you? With this book, you’ll gain a practical understanding along with the skills needed to use Service Workers and other technology central to building Progressive Web Apps. PWAs are pushing the mobile web forward, aim to bring parity to web and native apps, and help mobile developers reach users beyond the confines of native app stores.

With this book, learn how to build websites that take advantage of features that have so far been the exclusive domain of native apps. Reach out to your users with push notifications and homescreen icons, speed up your site significantly and provide a fully functional app even when your users are offline or suffering from bad connectivity.
