The first time I came into contact with Core Data was more than ten years ago. I was immediately overwhelmed by the terminology, the complex setup, and the many rules I had to stick to.

Does this sound familiar? I wondered if it was worth the hassle? And why did experienced developers swear by Core Data? How was I going to master Core Data and integrate it into an application without running into mysterious crashes?

The solution was surprisingly simple. Whenever I teach developers Core Data, I emphasize how important it is to focus on the fundamentals first. The vast majority of issues developers run into are caused by a lack of knowledge about the ins and outs of the framework. Core Data isn’t difficult if you understand how the framework works.

Over the years, I’ve taught thousands of developers how to use Core Data. This has taught me what the common pitfalls are developers run into. In Mastering Core Data With Swift, I show you the pitfalls you need to avoid.

The book follows a proven roadmap that starts with the fundamentals of the framework. We cover some theory, but, more importantly, you immediately apply what you learn to build a production application. Practice makes perfect. Right? This very much applies to any programming subject.

In Mastering Core Data With Swift, you learn everything you need to know to integrate Core Data in a new or an existing Swift project. We focus on the key players of the framework and build an application that takes advantage of the core features of the framework.

We use the latest and greatest to build an application. Xcode 9 has many improvements that make working with Core Data fantastic. And the intuitive syntax of Swift adds the cherry on the cake. It has never been easier to get started with Core Data.
