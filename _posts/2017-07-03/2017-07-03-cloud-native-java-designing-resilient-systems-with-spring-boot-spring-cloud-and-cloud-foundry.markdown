Learn the essentials of the Spring Boot microframework for developing modern, cloud-ready JVM applications and microservices across a variety of environments. With this practical book, you’ll learn everything you need to know to get started working with Spring Boot.

A modern cloud-native architecture looks very different from the architectures inspired by the economics of scale ten years ago. Now that the cloud is the default for everyone—and not just trailblazers like Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Netflix—Spring Boot and Spring Cloud offer the best tools to commoditize the architecture of the cloud. This book shows you how to leverage Spring Boot to build modular, highly-scalable applications.
