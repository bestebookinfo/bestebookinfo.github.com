- Connect to existing web services, process JSON, and create your own framework for the data display
- Use mixins, reflections, annotations, and other metadata programming techniques to create powerful app

### Who This Book Is For
If you are familiar with web development and are looking to learn, or even just evaluate, Dart as a multipurpose language, this learning path is for you. No familiarity with the Dart language is assumed. For beginners, it will serve as a guide to rapidly accelerate from a novice level to the master level; for intermediate to advanced developers it will quickly fill in the gaps on Dart and can explore a range of application types and powerful packages that are demonstrated in a practical manner.

### What You Will Learn
- Handle form data and encryption
- Set up your Dart environment to achieve the highest productivity
- Run and debug the Dart server and web applications and compile them in JavaScript
- Work with PostgreSQL—an industry standard relational database system
- Create robust applications with unit tests, documentation, and diagnostic logging
- Develop command-line applications, and explore the key data structures and libraries
- Detect and use HTML5 features that will help you deliver rich, cross-platform content
- Demonstrate the power of Polymer web components for binding data and structuring your web pages
### In Detail
Designed to create next generation apps, Google's Dart offers a much more robust framework and also supersedes JavaScript in several aspects. Familiar yet innovative, compact yet scalable, it blows away the accumulated JavaScript legacy limitations. Dart was designed for great tool-ability and developer productivity, allowing you to create better application faster than before. Google chose it for their billion dollar advertising business and you have its power for your projects too.

The first module will introduce you the Dart language starting from its conception to its current form, and where it headed is through engaging substantial practical projects. You will be taken through building typical applications and exploring the exciting new technologies of HTML5.

The second module will show you how to add internalization support to your web applications and how i18n and i10n access can be embedded into your code to design applications that can be localized easily. You will be shown how to organize client-to-server communication and how different HTML5 features can be used in Dart. Finally, this module will show you how you can store data locally, break the storage limit, and prevent security issues in your web application.

The third module is a pragmatic guide that will increase your expertise in writing all kinds of applications, including web apps, scripts, and server-side apps. It provides rich insights on how to extend your Dart programming skills.

Altogether, this course provides you the power to create powerful applications with Dart, without worrying about your knowledge leading to you having to make compromises to the end product!
